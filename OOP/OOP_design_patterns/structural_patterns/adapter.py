"""
Use the Adapter class when you want to use some existing class, 
but its interface isnâ€™t compatible with the rest of your code.

The Adapter pattern lets you create a middle-layer class that 
serves as a translator between your code and a legacy class, 
a 3rd-party class or any other class with a weird interface.
